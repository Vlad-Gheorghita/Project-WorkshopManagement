# Workshop Management
This is an application for managing the workshops. I used Windows Presentation Foundation for the client and web services for connecting the client with the database in C#.
I made an algorithm for checking the safety of the password. With this application, you can add, delete and modify a workshop if you are Admin and if you are a client you can use this application for seeing what workshops will take place.
